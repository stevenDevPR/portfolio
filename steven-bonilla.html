      <h3>Future Software Engineer!</h3>
      <div class="info-content">
        <h3 class="toggleButton">Who I am</h3>

        <p>I'm Steven Joel Bonilla Hidalgo, 27 years old, happily married, and the proud owner of Thunder, my Siberian Husky. My heart lies in the tech industry and programming, and I'm ready to turn that passion into a full-fledged career as a Software Engineer. I'm all about teamwork and collaboration, believing that together, we can achieve great things. Looking forward to the journey ahead!</p>

      <div class="info-content">
        <h3 class="toggleButton">A bit of my Background</h3>

        <p>My academic journey kicked off as a pre-med student at the University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez. However, my life took an unexpected turn with the arrival of Hurricane Maria, leading me to relocate to the mainland until November 2022 when I returned. Even before the hurricane, I had a lingering interest in Computer Science, a field that ignited a deep passion within me. Despite my enthusiasm, the employment landscape in Puerto Rico's tech industry at that time prevented me from making the switch, and my family had reservations. Throughout the years, my fascination with programming endured. I distinctly remember creating a virus at the age of 14 after watching online tutorials, sparking my interest in coding. During my time on the mainland, I committed myself to refining my programming skills through video tutorials, crafting projects like a Netflix clone, an Airbnb clone, a delivery app, and even the website you see today, all with tutorial assistance. Importantly, I was also part of the United States Sea Cadet Corps, achieving the rank of Chief Petty Officer. This experience not only improved my teamwork and leadership skills but also instilled in me the value of collaboration. Now, at Holberton School, I am excited to convert my passion into expertise, creating innovative programs independently and breaking free from the reliance on tutorials. </p>

        <h3 class="toggleButton">My Goals</h3>

        <p>My primary goal is to become a proficient and independent software developer, capable of conceiving and executing innovative programs. I am driven by the desire to create solutions that have a positive impact and contribute to the advancement of technology. In the long term, I aim to secure a position as a Software Engineer in a leading company, and the prospect of potentially joining a renowned firm like one of the FAANG companies is particularly appealing. I am committed to continuous learning, staying ahead of industry trends, and perfectioning my skills to not only meet but exceed the challenges presented in the dynamic field of software engineering.  </p>

      <div class="info-content">
        <h3 class="toggleButton">Why Holberton?</h3>

        <p>I am excited to join Holberton School due to its emphasis on practical, project-based learning. The collaborative environment, where students work together on diverse projects, aligns with my belief in the value of teamwork. The adaptive curriculum, designed to meet industry demands, assures me that I will acquire relevant and applicable skills. Holberton's commitment to diversity and inclusion is commendable and reflects my own values. I see Holberton as the ideal place to not only gain a strong technical foundation in software engineering but also to develop crucial interpersonal skills essential for a successful career in the field. Beside, the Aguadilla campus recently opened, was a go to go for me. I was looking for this opportunity to be able and learn in a non-virtual scenario.</p>
